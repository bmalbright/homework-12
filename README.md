## Details
### The assignment was to create a command line content management system that would allow the user to manage their employees. They would be able to view their departments, employee roles, and employees, add to each, and update their employees. 

## Packages and APIs used:
### Inquirer, mysql2, and console.table were installed for this application.

## Contributions
### I worked on this during zoom calls with a number of people, including Chuck Stephens, Ethan Cho, Mitchell Robbins, William Renfroe, among a few others. The one person I distinctly remember helping me with code was Mat Lundin, who helped me debug a few lines of my server.js. 

### The application has a MIT license.
